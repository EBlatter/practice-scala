We found that pattern matching was really easy to do in Scala. Really, just any functional programming was pretty straight-forward. There were lots of built-in functions for lists, which was very convenient. Standard object-oriented programming was pretty straight-forward too, though we found it difficult to mix it with the functional programming. Switching between the two was rather jarring. Overall, though, Scala felt like the Python of the Java world with little bits of Haskell sprinkled in.

We found the error messages difficult to understand, and it took more guessing and checking to fix them than we would have liked. It also seemed like a lot of the functionality had its own very specific syntax, so we had to check back with documentation frequently.

We liked that everything was immutable by default. It made it easier to do functional programming. We also liked that it fixed a lot of the more annoying peculiarities of Java, like having to have a class name be the same as the file name. In addition, we found that the type inference made the code look neater without losing clarity.

We didn't like companion objects. Though they do separate class and object level functionality, they seemed unnecessarily complicated and confusing to newcomers. However, perhaps if we understood them better, we would better be able to appreciate how they work.

We'd like to learn more about the nuances of pattern matching because it seems like a powerful and unique feature. Furthermore, we'd like to explore the interplay of the object-oriented and functional modes of development in Scala, as it seems that this where much of Scala's power comes from.

Overall, it seems like Scala is a powerful yet approachable language, and we are excited to learn more about it this semester!
